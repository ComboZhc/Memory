In my android apps I was getting annoying problems that whilst playing sound the volume buttons would control the media volume, but when no sound was playing they would control the ringtone volume. I found the following by trial and error, hopefully this post will help people with the same problem. This is done by placing a call of setVolumeControlStream in the onCreate part of your activity which takes on of the following valuesAudioManager.STREAM_MUSICAudioManager.STREAM_RINGAudioManager.STREAM_ALARMAudioManager.STREAM_NOTIFICATIONAudioManager.STREAM_SYSTEMAudioManager.STREAM_VOICECALLBelow shows the code required to set your applications default volume control to any of the above values:Media Volume (Music/Video etc...)view plaincopy to clipboardprint?this.setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC);  Ringtone Volumeview plaincopy to clipboardprint?this.setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_RING);  Alarm Volumeview plaincopy to clipboardprint?this.setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_ALARM);  Notification Volumeview plaincopy to clipboardprint?this.setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_NOTIFICATION);  System Volumeview plaincopy to clipboardprint?this.setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_SYSTEM);  Voicecall Volumeview plaincopy to clipboardprint?this.setVolumeControlStream(AudioManager.STREAM_VOICECALL);  I imagine this is also possible via and XML settings, if anyone knows of this I'd be very grateful to know how!
