1.Water Resources

The total volume of water on Earth is about 1.4 billion km3. The volume of freshwater resources is around 35 million km3, or about 2.5 percent of the total volume.

地球上的水资源总量位14亿立方千米，而淡水资源总量只有大约3500万立方千米，占2.5%

Of these freshwater resources, about 24 million km3 or 70 percent is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in mountainous regions, the Antarctic and Arctic regions.

这些淡水资源中，2400万立方千米(70%)是以冰和永久积雪的形式存在于山脉，南极和北极。

Around 30 percent of the world's freshwater is stored underground in the form of groundwater (shallow and deep groundwater basins up to 2 000 metres, soil moisture, swamp water and permafrost). This constitutes about 97 percent of all the freshwater that is potentially available for human use.

约30%的淡水是以地下水的形式存在的。这占我们可用淡水总量的97%。

• about 70 percent for irrigation

• about 22 percent for industry

• about 8 percent for domestic use
